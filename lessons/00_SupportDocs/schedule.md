## Day 1 Session 1 – Introduction to Automation and Ansible

- Understand why to automate Linux administration tasks with Ansible
- Learn what Ansible is, how Ansible works
- Install and configure Ansible on a Control Node
- Purpose of Ansible ad-hoc commands and the Ansible CLI toolset
- Run single automation tasks with Ansible ad-hoc commands

## Day 1 Session 2 – Inventories, configuration, first Playbooks

- Create a list (inventory) of the systems you manage, write a simple playbook, and run it to automate tasks
- Learn how Ansible inventories work and how to manage a simple static inventory file
- Inventory Hosts, Host groups, Nested groups, Host ranges, Host patterns
- Find out where Ansible configuration files are located and how Ansible decides which one to use
- Edit configuration files to change default settings
- Write and run a basic playbook with the ansible-playbook command
- Write a playbook with several plays, including privilege escalation

## Day 2 Session 3 – Modules, variables, facts

- YAML vs JSON syntax and semantics
- How to find modules and their documentation with `ansible-doc`
- Use variables and facts in playbooks to make them easier to manage and reuse
- Create and use variables that apply to specific hosts, groups, plays, or globally
- How Ansible decides which variable takes priority (Variable precedence)
- Magic variables (`hostvars`, `groups`, `inventory_hostname`, ...)
- Use Ansible facts to get system information from managed hosts
- Create your own custom facts

## Day 2 Session 4 – Vault, Tags

- Protect sensitive variables with Ansible Vault
- Create and edit vault secret files
- Run playbooks that use encrypted variable files
- Run or skip parts of a playbook with tags

## Day 3 Session 5 – Task control

- Conditions to decide when tasks should run
- Loops to repeat tasks efficiently
- Create tasks that only run when another task changes something on a host (handlers)
- Group tasks with blocks
- Control what happens if a task fails, and decide when a task should be marked as failed or changed

## Day 3 Session 6 – Templates

- Deploy files that are automatically customized with Jinja2 templates
- Jinja2 variables, filters, loops and conditionals
- Copy, fetch, create and edit files on Managed Hosts
- Control permissions and ownership of files

## Day 4 Session 7 – Roles

- Organize and simplify complex automation projects
- Difference between `include_*` and `import_*`
- Split large playbooks into smaller pieces by including or importing other files
- What roles are, how they are organized, and how to use them in Playbooks
- Create your own role inside a project and run it in a Playbook
- Best practices

## Day 4 Session 8 – Galaxy, Git

- Download and use roles and collections from Ansible Galaxy or Git repositories
- `requirements.yml`
- Use Linux System Roles to perform common system tasks
- Use configuration data (CMDB) from a Git repository in a playbook

## Day 5 Session 9 – Linux admin labs, troubleshooting

- Use Ansible to handle everyday Linux administration jobs: users, packages, services, sshd, backup, time sync
- Check mode and dry runs
- Find and fix problems with playbooks or managed hosts

## Day 5 Session 10 – Further topics, Summary, Q&A

- Ansible with Kubernetes
- Summary of the week, Q&A
